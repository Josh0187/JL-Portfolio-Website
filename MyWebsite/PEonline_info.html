            <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
            <p> This project was created as a course project for CMPT 276 Introduction to Software Engineering with the intention of developing an app that would enchance education under COVID restrictions. 
                After some discussion our team realized that many high-school physical education teachers were struggling to adapt to teaching PE in an online setting/under COVID restrictions. 
                Our intention with this app was to make it easier for those teachers to run their classes.
                Below is a video of the app in action. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHQ_49c6rHY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class = "youtube"></iframe>
            <p>Teachers can create a class and assign stationary or non-stationary exercises to students who join the class via a unique code. The students can then submit to the assignments by either taking a video of themselves or by using the app's
               GPS feature to track distance and time spent exercising.   
            </p>
            <p><strong>Complications</strong></p>
            <p>Unfortunately during the developement of the app, we lost two members (one being the project manager) of our group, leaving the three of us to do the best we could to finish the app meant to be a five person project before the due date. 
               We were all busy with other courses and also had communications issues as one of our group members did not speak english very well. 
               Due to these complications, we had to adapt our plans and redistribute the work loads. We did not get the desired result in the end but we were proud that we managed to create a functioning app to present to the class.
